# NSPCC Data Engineering Technical Take Home 

The NSPCC has recently employed a new online fundraising platform. This platform targets an audience that does not traditionally donate to the NSPCC.

To learn more, the Data Analytics team has requested data that they can use to analyse this new audience. 

The platform allows for data about the individuals and their donations to be retrieved through an API. The data is returned in a nested JSON format. 

## Task 

In the data folder are a set of JSON responses from the platform's API. Using any software or tooling you desire, process (or describe how you would process) these JSONs into a format ready for the Data Analytics team to query. 

The Data Analytics team are interested in answering the following questions; 

* How many unique individuals made donations?
* What was the total and average donation amount?
* What user characteristics lead to more donations? 
* How many donation payments failed?
* What proportion of donations came from individuals living in London vs those living outside of London?

(You should use the above questions to help you design your solution. You do not have to answer these questions as part of the exercise)


## Interview 

At the interview, you'll be invited to present your solution and the process by which you developed it. The interviewers will then ask a few follow-up questions about the design choices that you've made.
